# Global-Sales-Insights
I find it interesting to create visuals as until now i was seeing data in excel format only that is too boring but now by help of powerBi. 
I can visualize data according to my preferences or client's need.
While making this project I find new ways to interact with charts and bar graph.
I also like the map visualization. 
Now I can think of different ways to put data into graphs while reading the questions.
I tried my to best to mimic the charts with some tweaks in a better way.
